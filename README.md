# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

- The analysis previously performed for Pyber using Pandas & Madplotlib is extended in order to include a summary dataframe by city type and a multiple-line graph of total weekly fares by city type (Urban, Suburban & Rural).


## Results 

### Summary DataFrame

Two data frames were merged and subsequently the groupby function was executed to obtain the *fare per ride* and *fare per driver* averages. With this information the summary Dataframe by city type was created.

- The summary indicates that Urban city type has significantly more drivers than total rides. This has some impact on the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver. Urban drivers performed with lowest average fare per rider and earn less than other city types drivers. The ratio of total rides to total is drivers is similar for Suburban and Rural cities. Rural city type had the highest average fare per driver.

### Total fare by city type 

The original dataframe was modified for the dates data could be grouped by weeks in order to show the total fares by city type.
